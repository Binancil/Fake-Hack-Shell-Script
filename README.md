# Fake-Hack-Shell-Script
Hey guys! It's Josh.
This is a script I made in bash! (aka a shell script)
It runs a command which makes it look like your pc is hacking something.
Will say though, only works on Linux. Sorry mac and windows. If you do want to try this out,
get a virtual machine running!

## What it does

This script runs as a fake hacking script. When you say "Y" it does a command called hollywood, which makes sense
if you've seen hollywood hacker movies.

## How to install

#### Hollywood

On debian devices, run:
```
$ sudo apt install hollywood
```
If you use arch, run:
```
$ sudo snap install hollywood --classic
```

#### Bash
I'll assume you have bash (it's the default shell), but if you don't:

Debian:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install bash
```
Arch:
Google it, I can't fit it all here.

#### The script itself

Run:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Binancil/Fake-Hack-Shell-Script/
cd Fake-Hack-Shell-Script
clear
bash injection.sh
```
And there, we're done!
